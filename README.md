# ✅ Priora: Full-Stack Task Management Application

<p align="center">
  <b>A full-stack task management application built with Flask, SQLite, JavaScript, and modern web development practices.</b><br>
  Designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate backend development, database design, security implementation, and structured application architecture. This project is actively maintained and will continue to receive improvements as I expand my understanding of full-stack development.

# 📘 Project Overview

Priora is a full-stack task management application developed to demonstrate my progression from creating simple websites into building complete web applications with a backend, database, authentication system, and structured code architecture.

The purpose of this project is to create a realistic productivity application where users can create accounts, manage personal tasks, track progress, and maintain a history of task activity.

This project is built for **portfolio and educational purposes only**. It demonstrates my understanding of full-stack development concepts and is not intended to be used as a commercial productivity platform.

The main goal behind Priora was not only to create a functional application, but to understand how real-world applications are structured, maintained, and secured.

# 🚀 Development Journey

Priora represents an important stage in my development journey because it combines the frontend skills I previously developed with new backend and software engineering concepts.

Earlier projects focused mainly on creating visually appealing websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While those projects helped me understand layouts, styling, responsiveness, and user interaction, I wanted to move towards building applications that could store data, manage users, and perform real operations.

This project allowed me to learn:

- How frontend and backend systems communicate.
- How databases store and organise application data.
- How authentication systems work.
- How user data can be protected.
- How larger projects should be structured for maintainability.

One of the biggest improvements I made during this project was how I organise my CSS.

Instead of keeping all styling inside one large stylesheet, I began separating CSS into sections based on purpose and page requirements. This made development much easier because:

- Individual pages are easier to maintain.
- Changes are easier to locate.
- Styling conflicts are reduced.
- The project structure becomes clearer as the application grows.

This approach reflects how larger applications are often organised, where different components and features have their own responsibilities.

# ✨ Features

## 👤 User Accounts

Priora includes a complete authentication system allowing users to:

- Create an account.
- Securely log in.
- Reset their password.
- Change their password.
- Log out securely.
- Access only their own tasks.

Each user has their own private task data which is separated through database relationships.

---

## ✅ Task Management

Users can:

- Create new tasks.
- View upcoming tasks.
- View overdue tasks.
- View today's tasks.
- Update task information.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Search and filter tasks.

The application tracks task information including:

- Title.
- Description.
- Due date.
- Due time.
- Completion date.
- Completion status.

---

## 📋 Task History

A major feature of Priora is task logging.

The application records important task events, including:

- Task creation.
- Task completion.
- Task reopening.
- Task updates.
- User-added notes.

This creates an activity history, allowing users to understand how tasks have changed over time.

---

## 🌙 User Interface

The frontend includes:

- Responsive design.
- Dark mode support.
- Animated page elements.
- Client-side form validation.
- Dynamic interface updates.
- Mobile-friendly layouts.

JavaScript is used to improve user experience without replacing server-side validation.

# 🏗️ Application Architecture

Priora follows a structured Flask application design by separating responsibilities into different files.

```

## 🔐 Creating the `.env` File

VenTory requires a `.env` file in the root directory when running locally.

## ☁️ Cloudinary

Cloudinary is used to upload business logos and stock images.

Create a Cloudinary account or sign in to an existing one and obtain your API credentials.

Add the following to `.env`:

```
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://
```

Cloudinary images are not currently deleted when a stock item is removed from VenTory, so unused images may need to be removed manually from your Cloudinary account.

## 🔑 Secret Key

Flask requires a secret key for session management.

Generate one using Python:

```
import secrets

secret = secrets.token_hex(32)

print(secret)
```

Then add the generated value to `.env`:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key
```

Your `.env` file should contain:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://
```

## ⚙️ How The Application Works

### Flask Routes (`app.py`)

The Flask application acts as the connection between the user interface and backend services.

Routes handle requests such as:

- Loading pages.
- Processing forms.
- Creating tasks.
- Updating tasks.
- Authenticating users.

For example:

```python
@app.route("/user/tasks/add-task")
```
handles requests for creating new tasks.

The route receives user input, validates the information, then communicates with the database service.

### 🗄️ Database Layer (database.py)

The database service manages communication with SQLite.

It contains functions responsible for:

- Creating database tables.
- Adding users.
- Searching users.
- Creating tasks.
- Updating tasks.
- Removing tasks.
- Retrieving task history.

Using a separate database layer keeps SQL operations away from application routes, making the project easier to maintain.

### 📝 Task Service (tasks.py)

The task service sits between the Flask routes and database.

Its purpose is to handle task-related logic.

Examples:

### Loading Tasks

Retrieves active tasks belonging to the logged-in user.

### Searching Tasks

Allows tasks to be filtered by:

- Date.
- Completion status.
- Task ID.
- Completing Tasks

Updates the task status and creates a log entry recording the change.

Separating this logic prevents app.py from becoming too large and difficult to manage.

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

Security was an important learning area during this project.

Although Priora is a portfolio project, I wanted to implement practices used in professional applications.

### Password Protection

Passwords are never stored as plain text.

Priora uses:

- Argon2 password hashing.
- Secure password verification.
- Password reset protection.

Argon2 is designed specifically for password security and helps protect user credentials if database information is exposed.

### Session Security

User sessions are protected using Flask session management.

Implemented security features include:

- HTTP-only cookies.
- Secure cookies.
- SameSite cookie restrictions.
- Session expiration.
- Protected routes.
- CSRF Protection

Priora uses Flask-WTF CSRF protection.

Sensitive actions require valid CSRF tokens, including:

- Logging out.
- Creating tasks.
- Updating tasks.
- Deleting tasks.
- Changing task completion status.

This helps prevent malicious websites from submitting unwanted requests on behalf of users.

### Database Security

Database security measures include:

- Parameterised SQL queries.
- Foreign key relationships.
- User ownership checks.
- SQLite foreign key enforcement.

Users can only access and modify their own tasks.

### Content Security Policy

The application includes security headers using Content Security Policy (CSP).

This restricts where scripts, styles, and resources can be loaded from, helping reduce certain browser-based attacks.

## 🗄️ Database Design

Priora uses three main database tables.

### Users Table

- user_id
- first_name
- last_name
- email
- password
- date_created

### Tasks Table

Stores user tasks.

- task_id
- user_id
- title
- description
- due_date
- due_time
- completed
- completion_date
- completion_time
